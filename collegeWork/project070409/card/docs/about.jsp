<p align="center">About</p>
<p align="center">IIS is a social utility that helps people better understand the  world around them. IIS develops technologies that facilitate the  spread of information through social networks allowing people to share  information online the same way they do in the real world. IIS is  made up of many networks - individual schools, companies or regions -  each of which are independent and closed off to non-affiliated users.  To join IIS, people can authenticate into a school or work  network, or they can join a regional network. They can then create  profiles to connect with friends, share interests, join groups, send  messages, writes notes and post photos.</p>
