<p>IIS follows two core principles:</p>
<p> <strong>1. You should have control over your personal information.</strong> <br />
  IIS helps you share information with your friends and people  around you. You choose what information you put in your profile,  including contact and personal information, pictures, interests and  groups you join. And you control with whom you share that information  through the privacy settings on the My Privacy page. </p>
<p> <strong>2. You should have access to the information others want to share.</strong> <br />
  There is an increasing amount of information available out there, and  you may want to know what relates to you, your friends, and people  around you. We want to help you easily get that information. </p>
<p>Sharing information should be easy. And we want to provide you with  the privacy tools necessary to control how and with whom you share that  information.</p>
