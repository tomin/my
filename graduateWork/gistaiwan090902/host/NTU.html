              <p>The predecessor of National Taiwan University was Taihoku (Taipei) Imperial University, founded by the Japanese in 1928. </p>
              <p>The first president was Dr. Shidehara Tan Tairaka Hiroshi. When Taihoku University was first established, it had two colleges: the College of Liberal Arts and Law, and the College of Science and Agriculture, and had a combined total of 60 students. The College of Medicine and the College of Engineering were added in 1936 and 1943 respectively. The College of Science and Agriculture was also divided into two colleges in 1943: the college of Science , and the college of Agriculture . The college of Agriculture was divided into three sections: the College of Agriculture and Forestry, the College of Medicine , and the Graduate Institute of Tropical Medicine. </p>
              <p>During Taihoku Imperial University period, every college consisted of &quot;lectures&quot;, which were conducted by a professor and included assistant professors, assistants, instructors and office employees. In 1945, the five colleges had 114 lectures with 382 students. The College of Liberal Arts and Law had 25 lectures, the College of Medicine had 24, the College of Science had 13, the College of Agriculture had 22, and the College of Engineering had 30. </p>			  
              <p>After World War II and Taiwan's retrocession to Chinese Sovereignty, the R.O.C. government resumed the administration of Taihoku University and reorganized and renamed it "National Taiwan University" on November 15, 1945, with Dr. Lo Tsung-lo serving as the first president. The College of Liberal Arts and Law was divided into two colleges: the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Law. The University thus consisted of six colleges (Liberal Arts, Law, Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture) and had twenty-two departments with 500 odd students. The Evening Division, the College of Management , the College of Public Health , and the College of Electrical Engineering (renamed as the College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2000) were established respectively in 1967, 1987, 1993, and 1997. In 1999, the College of Social Sciences replaced the College of Law , and the Department of Law was upgraded to become the College of Law . The evening division and the Center of Continuing Education were also combined into the Division of Continuing Education &amp; Professional Development. In 2002, the College of Agriculture was renamed the College of Bio-Resources and Agriculture. In 2003, the College of Life Science was established. As of the 2004 academic year, the University has a total of eleven colleges, 54 departments, 96 graduate institutes (which offer 96 Master's programs and 83 doctoral programs), and four research centers: the Division of Population and Gender Studies, the Center for Condensed Matter Sciences, the Center for Biotechnology, Japanese Research Center, and the Biodiversity Center. The number of students reached 29,877 in 2004, including the students from the division of Continuing Education &amp; Professional development. A new library was built in 1998, and now contains over 3,000,000 volumes of books. </p>
              <span class="global_content_subtitle_v2">University Motto </span>
			  <span id="ntu3"><img src="../images/NTU3.jpg"></span>
              <p>The University's motto, &quot;Cultivate virtue, advance intellect; love one's country, love one's people,&quot; is adopted from a line in the speech made by President Ssu-nien Fu in 1949 on a memorial occasion celebrating the fourth anniversary of the University. The line is intended to encourage students of National Taiwan University , except that the word he originally used is &quot;to study hard&quot; instead of the present version &quot;to advance intellect&quot; The phrase &quot;Cultivate virtue, advance intellect&quot; was first transcribed by President Ssu-liang Chien when he gave inscription to the Main Library in January, 1969. Then President Chen-hsin Yen further applied the eight-word motto and carved them on the outer wall of the Gymnasium's facade. Meanwhile a bust of the late President Fu was erected on campus, with this established motto inscribed onto the base of the bust. </p>

              <span class="global_content_subtitle_v2">Prospects</span>
			  <span id="ntu2"><img src="../images/NTU2.jpg"></img></span>
              <p>Being the first integrated and most prestigious institution of higher education in Taiwan area, National Taiwan University has taken up the responsibility of promoting the level of academic research study and teaching in Taiwan , and has from the very start put emphasis on scholarly research in basic theory and on free atmosphere of academic thought. The University thus sets its objective for development in three major fields: humanities and social sciences, basic sciences, and applied sciences. To coordinate with the demands of our national and social developments, the University plans to expand, as needs be, those Departments and Institutes of high applicability into various professional colleges beyond its present nine colleges. Being the leading integrated university in Taiwan and responsible for training researchers and technicians in practical fields, the University hopes to increase gradually the number of graduate students and to decrease proportionally the number of undergraduates. Among graduate students, more Ph. D. programs will be organized to upgrade research standards and to meet our country's demand for high-tech expertise. On the other hand, to satisfy modern people's wish for multifarious knowledge offered in college and to fulfill the social function of college education through feedback, the University will also promote programs of extension education by giving on-job training to adults or people in need, in order to lay a solid foundation for the lifetime education of an ideal adulthood in the 21st century. Being the most representative university in Taiwan , the University intends to make more exchange programs and sign cooperative agreements with famous foreign universities, to achieve the goal of broadening our international scope. The University also encourages its faculty members to join research study groups more actively to establish research centers, and to further intercollegiate inter-disciplinary engagements. Meanwhile, an institute will be set up to supervise the developments and directions of future researches, making evaluations, coordination, and sanction. In addition, the University will utilize new technological achievements and information network, to establish such advanced systems of tele-communicative teaching, tele-communicative medical treatment cooperation, etc., to create a complete and computerized environment for more advanced research and teaching. </p>
              <span class="global_content_subtitle_v2">University Emblem </span>
			  <img id="ntu4" src="../images/NTU4.jpg"></img>
			  <p>The National Taiwan University has long been known for its tradition, distinguished faculty, and well-equipped facilities. Over the years its graduates have made tremendous contributions to both the nation and to society. In order to enhance this valuable tradition and provide guidance to future generations, the founding goals and philosophy of the school have been instilled into the university emblem as an inspiration to all faculty and students. </p>			  			  
              <span class="global_content_subtitle_v2">University Flower </span>			  
			  <p>The azaleas are one of the most famous symbols associated with the National Taiwan University, which justly carries the name "Azalea City." Every spring since 1996 the university has held an Azalea Festival when the flowers come into full bloom as a means to promote relations between the university and the public. </p>
