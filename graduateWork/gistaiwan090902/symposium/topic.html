              Three topics are prepared for participants to compose their essays. The actual contents of the events during the sessions will be more diversified. Please refer to the study guides for more information about GIS Taiwan 2009.
			  <p>As the old saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." A decade ago, the world once pondered the potential issues we would encounter at the coming of the millennium. Now, another rigorous challenge, the financial turmoil commencing since the second half of 2007, lies before us while all international actors are trying to find a way out. It is our responsibility, as individual members of the global village, to acknowledge, record and analyze, great events long the course of human history. We envisage that these acknowledgements, records and analysis would define the problems, and generate the most adequate solution.</p>
			  <p>The topic: "Challenges & Opportunities — the Global Economy in the Transition Phase" shall be examined and discussed thoroughly throughout this symposium. We hope to gather talented youth from a variety of cultural background around the world, in the hope of obtaining cross-country fertilization and innovative perspectives on this far-reaching event through discussion, brainstorming, and collaboration. A broader scope is expected to be taken as we try not to narrow ourselves down to only financial and economic issues.</p>
			  <p>It’s a chance for you to be a "fortune-teller", or even the one who shapes the future world landscape. The impacts and implications of the worldwide financial turmoil shouldn’t be ignored. The conference aims to give participants the position of “where we currently are” after the financial tsunami, in the meantime to provide a possible directions for our future careers and lives. Therefore, we believe it would be interesting to recall and examine, years later, the fruitful results yielded in this conference. And we also firmly believe that issues discussed here will have surprisingly intimate interaction with the world.</p>

              <p><span class="global_content_subtitle">Subtopic 1: Rethinking of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Social Entrepreneurship </span></p>
              <p>In the past few years, the relationship between "corporations" and the "society" has transformed significantly. </p>
              <p>Today, most companies endeavor to involve themselves in philanthropy activities to demonstrate to the public that they indeed care about the society while pursing their primary business goals - profits. A recent survey showed that over 95% of CEOs indicated that the society has higher expectations for the corporations to take on more social responsibilities than it did five years ago. These phenomena seem to point out one changing trend in the business field: that Corporate Social Responsibility, which once seemed only to play a supporting role on the stage, may now be hosting the show in the business world.</p>
			  <p>McKinsey's surveys in 2007, however, revealed that CSR was simply superficial for most companies and proved that CSR was implicitly only a flashing fad. Moreover, Milton Friedman, the Nobel Laureate in Economics Science, in his 1970 article entitled "The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits" contended that enterprises' managers did not have the right to represent their stockholders to perform excessive social responsibilities. Many of the anti-CSR discussions prompted by the recent global financial crisis might stem from some of these concepts. On the other hand, firms seen excessively carrying out CSR are encouraged, by NGOs and CSR advocates, to take on additional responsibilities that do not agree with the fundamental goals of their businesses.</p>
			  <p>Responding to the trend that more people are concerned about the society, a group of people is now adopting a different measure to realize their view on social responsibility. They are the so-called "social entrepreneurs." They recognize and focus on social issues and apply entrepreneurial principles to organize a venture to solve the social problems they observe. Different from business entrepreneurs, they assess the performance of their approaches in terms of the impact they have on the society. For example, one well-known contemporary social entrepreneur is Muhammad Yunus, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with Grameen Bank, which he founded.</p>
			  <p>However, social entrepreneurs face many potential challenges. They may not obtain enough support to achieve their goals. In addition, they may sometimes make wrong business decisions. This is because there is no supervisory third party to oversee their activities, causing their organizations to become monopolies in certain fields. When such a situation occurs, valuable resources would be wasted.</p>
			  <p>After rethinking the definitions of CSR and social entrepreneurship, please describe a problem that might emerge and elaborate it with possible solutions. </p>

              <p><span class="global_content_subtitle">Subtopic 2: Bliss or Misery? — Contemplating the Engagement of Cultural Forms and Economic Progress </span></p>
              <p>The engagement of culture and economic progress has been a rising concern. Increasing interaction and intensifying tension between culture and economic progress, particularly sharpened by globalization, have drawn the attention of many political entities and economic organizations. In the past, economists used to exclude culture from decision making; now many of them address it as an indispensible part of economic policy. In the World Bank and UNESCO, many projects have been developed regarding the beneficial effects of both culture sustainability and economic development. With the global economy in transition, it is crucial to contemplate the engagement of culture and economic progress, as well as its potential risk and opportunity.</p>
			  <p>When considering the relation between culture and economic progress, complex situations and variable opportunities, worthy of further examination and inquiry, exist. For instance, the Cultural and Creative Industry (CCI) is considered a brand-new form for combining culture and economy. By either innovation or refinement, CCI integrates the culture elements into profitable business. Yet, criticisms arise when concerns are voiced by some cultural workers, that the combination of culture with business may smother the creativity and debase the original cultural values. In the case of regional development, for another example, when the utmost priority is economic development, the culture value of a society might be at the same time compromised and thus go through great changes. Changing values, such as the possible negligence on environmental-friendly policy and business ethic, may in turn have negative influences on continuous development. Even on the individual level, rich cultural-economic context may be observed. The development of Internet and new technology fosters an Internet culture which highlights sharing by mouse clicks. Behaviors and ethics online are now getting people’s attention, as well as to its considerable impact on the economic pattern.</p>
			  <p>Choose a specific case which sheds light on further study to the engagement of culture and economic progress and then analyze it thoroughly and creatively. What’s the relation between culture and economic progress in the case? Are there any potential risks or possible opportunities? How can one minimize the risks or make the most of the opportunities?</p>

              <p><span class="global_content_subtitle">Subtopic 3: Find the Next Wave to Ride On — New Business Strategies in the Changing World </span></p>
              <p>"You can never step into the same river twice." Ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus said. The world never stops changing. Some changes are small and temporary, while others are significant, irresistible and thus become worldwide phenomenon. These are referred to as a "trend." A trend is defined as "a general development or change in a situation that people are behaving." It is inevitable, continuous, and makes a great impact on people's lives, as well as the business entities involved.</p>
			  <p>Evidently, there is a link between business and trend. The core concept of business is about "people," and most people follow trends. However, a trend fades away when it is no longer able to attract the public's attention by going down the road not taken before. Unwise decisions are made and companies would not survive when the businesses fail to recognize the shifts of the market. Therefore, whether or not a company is aware of and properly responds to a trend, has become a determining factor of its survival.</p>
			  <p>To survive, individual companies or entire industries adjust themselves in correspondence of those shifts. For example, after Apple Inc. revealed its iPhone, a technological instrument combining a mobile phone and a personal computer, both cell phone makers and the PC industry felt threatened. Now, almost every cell phone company is dedicated to the development of new mobile phones to match iPhone’s usefulness and humaneness. One significant competitor, Google Inc., has announced the release of their new product, G-phone, as a revolutionary device which includes all programs Google offered online. A "smart phone," as its official title reads.</p>
			  <p>As new trends are being formed, the financial tsunami is also forcing numerous entities into reformation. The stricter-than-ever environmental standards are pressing old products to adapt. As the world becomes increasingly aware of developing trends, how will they affect business entities? More importantly, how should businesses involved respond to the flow of changes?</p>
