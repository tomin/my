<h2><a href="#0" name="0">Introduction</a></h2>
Taiwan’s industrial safety and health efforts began in 1947. There was an industrial health section in Department of the Health Bureau of the Provincial Government engaged in occupational disease prevention work. Later, after some serious incidents resulting from occupational hazards in the workplace, the Labor Safety and Health Act was passed in 1974, making Taiwan the second nation in Asia (and third in the world) with labor safety and health laws. In 1987, a labor safety and health committee was established under the Executive Yuan, and that raised the level of labor safety and health regulatory organizations to the departmental level. Taiwan currently has about 10.4 million laborers and about 40,000 occupational safety and health professionals. The government has been striving to care for laborers, and every year it launches many projects to reduce and prevent occupational hazards. More than NT$1 billion has been spent for these projects.


<h2><a href="#1" name="1">1 Occupational safety and health (OSH) legislative framework</a></h2>
<h3>1.1 Provisions of the Constitution</h3>
The constitution of the Republic of China (1947) states in its Article 15, that “The right of existence, the right of work, and the right of property shall be guaranteed to the people.” The constitution also specifies that the government should enforce laws and implement policies that protect labors.
<h3>1.2 Major laws on occupational safety and health (OSH) </h3>
The Council of Labour Affairs (CLA) is the authority of the six main laws related to occupational safety and health: the Factory Law, the Labour Inspection Law, the Labour Insurance Act, Labour Safety and Health Act, Labour Standards Act, and the Protection for workers Incurring Occupational Accidents Act.<br/><br/>
The Factory Law was established in 1929, with 77 Articles, and implemented in 1931. All factories that use engines are applied to this law. The Labour Inspection Law was announced in 1931 with 20 Articles, for the implementation of labour inspection, the enforcement of all labour laws, protection of the labour and employer rights, stabilizing the society and economy growth.<br/><br/> 
The Labour Insurance Act was announced in 1958 with 87 Articles and implemented in 1960. The main goal is to protect the lives of the labours and enhance social security. The Labour Safety and Health Act is established in 1974 with 34 Articles to prevent occupational accidents and to ensure the health and safety of labours.<br/><br/>
Labour Standards Act is set up in 1984 with 86 Articles, the main idea is to regulate the minimum standard of labour conditions, protect labour rights, and enhance the labour and employer relationships. The Protection for workers Incurring Occupational Accidents Act is formulated in 2001 with 41 Articles and implemented in 2002. The aim is to protect the rights of workers in occupational accidents, enhance preventions of occupational accidents, and promote employment safety and economic growth.
<h3>1.3 Laws and regulations related to OSH</h3>
Regarding the general labour laws, Taiwan also has Gender Equality in Employment Act (2002), Labour Union Law (1929), Employees' Welfare Funds Act (1943), Employment Services Act (1992), and Regulations for the Allocation and Management of the Workers' Retirement Reserve Funds (1986).<br/><br/>
When it comes to chemical control, Taiwan also has regulations such as Regulations of Organic Solvent Poisoning Prevention, Standards for Measurement of Work Environment, Standards of Permissible Exposure Limits of Airborne Hazardous Substance in Workplace, Toxic Chemical Substances Control Act, Environmental Agents Control Act, Agro-pesticides Management Act, Waste Disposal Act and more.


<h2><a href="#2" name="2">2 National policy review mechanisms</a></h2>
The Council of Labor Affairs was established on August 1, 1987 under Executive Yuan as a cabinet-level agency in charge of national labor affairs. The Council has one minister, two deputy ministers, and 7~11 commissioners recruited by the minister representing opinions of employers, employees, political, and academic circles to review labor policies, labor laws and regulations, as well as related projects and programs.
<br/><br/>
The Council of Labor Affairs has established eight departments, namely, Department of Labor Relations, Department of Labor Standards, Department of Labor Welfare, Department of Labor Insurance, Department of Labor Safety and Health, Department of Labor Inspection, Department of Planning, and Department of Statistics, together with a Central Region Office; there are also Secretariat, Personnel Office, Accounting Office, Civil Service Ethics Office, Information Management Center, Petitions and Appeals Committee, and Legal Affairs Committee established under the Council; at the same time, there are nine other affiliated agencies, namely, Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training, Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Northern Region Inspection office, Central Region Inspection Office, Southern Region Inspection Office, Labor Insurance Supervisory Committee, Bureau of Labor Insurance, Labor Pension Fund, and Institutes of Labor Education.
<br/><br/>
Labor is the foundation of social and economic development of any country.With the challenges posed by an increasingly globalized economy, accelerated industry upgrading and corporate globalization, the government must shoulder the responsibilities of providing a high-quality labor force, strengthening national economic competitiveness, responding to changes in mployer-employee relations, securing labor welfare, and sharing the fruits of economic development with workers. With the increased average life span of Taiwan population, aging society and fewer children are becoming inevitable trends. It is thus important to cover topics such as preparing for the retirement life of workers and maintaining a sufficient supply of labor through labor policies. 
<br/><br/>
Equity, Humanity, Security, and Dignity are the four core principles for the Council of Labor Affairs.
<br/><br/>
At present, the focus of labor policies is to promote labor rights, labor security, work quality and life quality, and to use progressive labor market policy and active market manipulation to enhance labor capability and labor participation rates; and to assist the less privileged to actively participate in the job market and protect their work rights through integrated measures in the society. At the same time, effectively follow the trends and demands of the job market to strengthen the capability of the labor force and provide high-quality workers needed by enterprises.
<br/><br/>
At this phase, the Council's visions are to create an equal, dignified, secure and humane work environment in Taiwan from the perspective of career development for laborers.
<h3>Major Administrative Efforts</h3>
<ol>
	<li>To develop high-quality labor force and to strengthen job security：</li>

</ol>

<h2><a href="#3" name="3">3 Coordination and collaboration mechanisms</a></h2>
To balance the power of employers and employee and to stabilize economic development, International Labor Organization (ILO) have centered right to organize, collective bargaining, and right to dispute as the core of labor standards. They are served as the benchmarks for international community to assess the labor rights of individual countries. In Taiwan, Labor Union Law, Collective Agreement Law, and Settlement of Labor Disputes Law are in place to realize right to organize, collective bargaining, and right to dispute so as to ensure labor's right to life and work.
<h3>Labor Union</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A labor union is defined as: a permanent association organized democratically by a group of workers who have banded together to achieve common goals in maintaining and improving working conditions and uplifting economic status.</li>
	<li>In accordance with Article 6 of the Labor Union Law, labor union can be categorized into craft union and industrial union. The term "industrial union" shall mean the union organized by workers of different crafts in various divisions of one and the same industry. Whereas the term "craft union" shall mean the union jointly organized by workers of one and the same craft. Base on Article 47, 48, 49, and 50 of the Law, unions can organize federation of labor unions when all the legal terms are met.</li>

	<li>3.	Statistics of labor union in Taiwan as of the end of 2007 are listed below:
(1) Number of basic industrial union: 995, with 580,315 members.
(2) Number of basic craft union: 3,376, with 2,453,347 members.
(3) Number of general federation: 75, with 3,783 group members.
(4) Number of federation of labor union: 141, with 1,122 group members.
(5) Number of labor union: 4,574, with 3,026,508 member, and 35.8% organization rate.
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Negotiation between Employers and Employees</h3>
The major ways for negotiation between employers and employees are collective bargaining and labor-management conference. The purpose of collective bargaining is to sign Collective Agreement Law. Collective Agreement Law refers to a written contract, concluded between an employer or an incorporated organization of employers on one hand and an incorporated organization of workers on the other hand for the purpose of specifying labor relations.
<br/><br/>
Labor-management conference is a negotiation system to facilitate labor relations, enhance labor cooperation, and prevent various labor related issues beforehand. The basic principles are to encourage voluntary negotiation and cooperation between employers and employees to enhance communications in enterprises, reduce confrontation, increase consensus and eventually converge collective wisdom and potential to implement the agreed conclusions.
<br/><br/> 
As of the end of 2007, 71 companies in total have signed the collective agreements, and up to 16,596 companies have convened labor-management conference.
<h3>APEC Chemical Dialogue</h3>
The APEC Chemical Dialogue held each year allows the Council of Labour Affairs and the Industrial Development Bureau to cooperate with employers’ organization and discuss about chemical management issues.


<h2><a href="#4" name="4">4 OSH technical standards, guidelines and management systems</a></h2>
<h3>4.1 Implementation of OSH management systems</h3>
The Occupational Safety and Health Act covers the basic idea of safety and health management, which is the key principle for carrying out safety and health obligations set on the employer. It requires systematic and continuous monitoring of working conditions and eliminating hazards and risk factors, and also emphasizes that safety management and operating procedures shall be carried out in a way that is most suitable and best for the individual enterprise itself.
<br/><br/>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) of Taiwan continues implementing programs to protect the safety and health of labors by encouraging and facilitating enterprise implementing the Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System (TOSHMS), carrying out self-management, continuously improving the performances of occupational safety and health and preventing occupational accidents or illness. The CLA adapts international management system framework to encourage organizations integrating occupational risk assessment into their best practices of business operation.
<br/><br/>
Taiwan has promoted BS 8800 and Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSAS 18001) since 1996, and was one of contributors to the revision of international OHSAS 18001. Be in line with ILO-OSH 2001, Guidelines of TOSHMS was issued by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) in 2007. The TOSHMS consists of structural elements of OHSAS 18001:2007, and also adopts the framework and relevant requirements of ILO-OSH 2001. 
<br/><br/>
Enterprises certified by TOSHMS will also meet with the OHSAS 18001 (2007) so as to achieve the aim of “one validation for two certifications”. Through some commercial certification bodies of OHSAS 18001, designated and quality-controlled by the CLA, any organization that passes TOSHMS certification could attain the OHSAS 18001 certificate at the same time, satisfying both “attaining international certification” and “in compliance with domestic guideline”.
<br/><br/>
Enterprise in Taiwan is required to implement effective OSH management system. At this moment, implementation of the TOSHMS is not mandatory, however, enterprise is encouraged to implement.  Enterprise implementing its own in-house OSH management system is also encouraged to obtain the performance recognition from CLA.
<br/><br/>
By August 2010, there are around 500 enterprises passing the TOSHMS certification, and the average reduction of occupational accident rate as compared with those without TOSHMS certification is around 20% reduction. To continuously improving performance and preventing occupational accidents and ill health, voluntary TOSHMS families have been established to facilitate the experience sharing of OSH self- management in 2010.
<br/><br/>
In near future, CLA will issue a special TOSHMS guideline for construction industry and the Economic ministry will publish national standards for OSHMS. The risk assessment campaign and enlargement of TOSHMS families will continuously launch to protect the health and safety of Taiwan workforces.
<h3>4.2 Information materials based on ILO Technical Standards and Codes of Practice</h3>
<h4>Guidelines by various institutions</h4>
The Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, IOSH, is a research institute under the jurisdiction of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), Executive Yuan. Its important missions include application of scientific technology, surveys and analyses of various risk factors in the working environment, as well as development of countermeasures. The IOSH continuously updates practical guidelines on various occupational safety topics, such as mechanical, electrical, construction, and chemical safety, as well as function of personal protection equipment. It also provides guidelines on occupational hygiene, such as prevention of musculoskeletal injuries through ergonomics.
<h4>Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS)</h4>
Improper use of hazardous chemicals will result in poisoning and cancer of workers, as well as disasters such as fire and explosion. It is thus imperative for workers to know more about chemicals and a consistent system for classification and labeling of chemicals is in need. To cope with the implementation of Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) by the United Nations in 2008, the Council of Labor Affairs plans to propose "GHS Project (2006-2008)". The project will be implemented after the approval of the Executive Yuan. It involves agencies including labor, environmental protection, transportation, fire, etc.
<br/><br/>
The Council of Labor Affairs has already developed "GHS for Dangerous and Hazardous Substances" to be implemented simultaneously with other government agencies by the end of 2008. To assist industry practitioners to implement GHS system, the Council has established websites and online teaching services regarding GHS of chemicals, telephone and voice automatic fax services, expansion of GHS websites providing classification meeting GHS regulations, 1648 labelings, safety data table with 1597 data entries. At the same time, mixture claasificaiton professional system is established, train the trainer program is conducted, and chemical practitioner guidance and training programs are provided so that the business entities can easily access to information on the implementing of GHS system.


<h2><a href="#5" name="5">5 OSH system implementation: Means and tools</a></h2>
<h3>5.1 National competent bodies with OSH implementation  responsibilities</h3>
<p>The Council of Labour Affairs (CLA) is the authority responsible  for the occupational safety and health administration in Taiwan’s government  which believes that safeguarding safety and health of labor in the workplace is  not only the basic labor rights, but also a critical indicator for national  progress. Since the establishment of the Council on August 1, 1987, hazard  mitigation has been an important task for the Council. In order to cope with  the national industrial trend and demand at various phases of hazard  mitigation, programs of hazard mitigation are proactively promoted including  amendment to the labor safety and health regulations, annual focal inspection  directions, and strengthening of prevention and research of occupational  hazards. The Council developed Promotional Program for Occupational Safety and  Health to promote the administrative visions of &quot;occupational  safety&quot;, &quot;physical and mental health&quot;, &quot;comfortable work  environment&quot; and &quot;friendly workplace&quot;, etc, to realize the  protection of human rights in Taiwan.<br />

</div>
<div>
  <h4>5.1.1 Inspection and enforcement systems</h4>
  <p>With regard to Labour inspection, the Council has practically  amended Labor Inspection Law to lay a good foundation for Taiwan's labor  inspection system since 1987. As a result, the number and frequency of  inspections and punishment rate have increased significantly, and occupational disasters  are under effective control.</p>
  <p>Promotion of Labor inspection is handled by the central competent  authority (the Council) or to be authorized to the competent authorities of  municipalities, or related labor inspection agencies. Aside from the responsibility  of planning for labor inspection strategies, regulation implementation, and  supervision, the central competent authority also established Northern Region  Inspection Office, Central Region Inspection Office, and Southern Region  Inspection Office to handle the inspection business. In addition, agencies  authorized by the central competent authority to handle labor inspection  include Export Processing Zone Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs,  Science Park Administration, Central Taiwan Science Park Provisional Office,  and Southern Taiwan Science Park Administration, etc.</p>
  <p>Scope of labor inspection includes the compliance of Labor  Inspection Act, Labor Standards Act, Labor Safety and Health Act, Labor  Insurance Act, Employee Welfare Fund Act, Employment Service Act, etc. and  other related laws. In addition, dangerous machinery and facilities will be  inspected by labor inspectors dispatched by labor inspection agencies, as well  as proxy inspectors dispatched by proxy inspection organizations.</p>
  <p>To achieve one of the three major administrative goals of the  Council, &quot;Safe environment&quot;, the Council has gradually promoted  various disaster mitigation projects which have effectively reduced the death  toll of occupational disasters in all industries from 77 per million in 2000 to  36 per million in 2008. In the future, the Council will continue to promote  disaster mitigation programs based on the principles of &quot;Life can't wait  &quot; and &quot;Can't repeat life&quot;. At present, the Council is planning  to develop a cross-agency &quot;Promotion Project for Occupational Safety and  Health&quot;, in the hope of inviting other related competent authorities to  jointly promote disaster mitigation projects so as to safeguard work safety and  health of our citizens.</p>
  <p>Aside from the Northern Region Inspection Office, Central Region  Inspection Office, and Southern Region Inspection Office under the Council,  there are an additional six labor inspection agencies authorized by the Council  with 309 inspectors including Labor Inspection Office of Taipei City  Government, Labor Inspection Office of Kaohsiung City Government, Science Park  Administration, Central Taiwan Science Park Administration, Southern Taiwan  Science Park Administration, and Export Processing Zone Administration,  Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
  <p>In addition, inspection of dangerous machinery and facilities are  consigned to seven proxy inspection agencies including Industrial Safety and  Health Association of Taiwan, R.O.C., Crane Association of Taiwan, R.O.C.,  Mechanical Safety Association of Kaohsiung City, Chinese Boiler Association,  Taiwan Boiler Association, Chinese Pressure Vessel Association, and Chinese  Institute of the Labor Force with a total of 106 proxy inspectors.</p>
  <p>Strategies of Labor Inspection:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Adopt 3-in-1 approach of &quot;promotion,  inspection, and guidance&quot; to improve the safety and health levels of  workplace.</li>
    <li>Strengthen registration, classified  management, monitoring, and inspection of construction industry, highly risky  industries or workplace.</li>
    <li>Strengthen training of labor inspectors  and establishment of labor inspection technical manual and guidelines to  enhance the effectiveness of labor inspection.</li>
    <li>Establish approaches and environment  in favor of self-management of organizations and business to change the  attitude of safety and health in business entities so as to jointly mitigate  the occurrence of occupational disasters.</li>
    <li>Integrate efforts of promotional  associations of labor safety and health, regional prevention organizations, and  industrial associations to jointly engage in the work of promoting safety and  health.</li>
    <li>Coordinate with other government  agencies to conduct joint audits so as to shoulder the responsibilities of  disaster prevention and establish the culture of high quality public  construction projects which are safe and healthy.</li>
    <li>Establish prevention and guidance  approaches for occupational disasters; provide small and premium enterprises  and specific manufacturing industries with diagnosis, guidance and consultation  of safety and health.</li>
    <li>Develop high quality safety and  health technical service system; provide business entities with effective  information and management approaches in terms of safety and health.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection (BSMI) under the  Ministry of Economic Affairs is the authority responsible for standardization,  metrology and product inspection in Taiwan, including chemical properties and  product safety.  BSMI is also responsible  for setting national standard for chemical testing and hazard categorization.<br />
    <h4>5.1.2 OSH research institutions and  OSH laboratories OSH research institutions</h4>
    <h4>Environmental Analysis Laboratory, EPA, Executive Yuan</h4>
  <p>The Environmental Analysis Laboratory (EAL) was established on  January 10, 1990 to provide policymakers with the necessary environmental data.  The EAL is divided into five divisions: (1) planning and management of  environmental analysis, (2) air and physical analysis, (3) water analysis, (4)  toxic substances, waste and soil analysis, (5) environmental biological  testing. The EAL's mission is threefold: to effectively upgrade the quality of  national environmental analysis data, to actively enhance the capability of  public and private environmental analytical laboratories, and to provide  support to meet the environmental analysis requirements of all levels of  environmental protection authorities in line with the principles of efficiency,  quality data, and credibility. To enhance quality assurance and environmental  analysis credibility, the EAL received laboratory accreditation from NATA  (National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia) on January 31, 1995.</p>
  <h4>Institute of Occupational Safety and Health</h4>
  <p>Institute of Occupational Safety and Health was established in  August 1992 and has become the most important research institute in Taiwan  dedicated to occupational safety and health. In order to conduct research more  systematically, the Institute brought up the &quot;Short, medium, and long term  research plan for Institute of Occupational Safety and Health&quot; for the  first time in 1994. In 1997, 2001, and 2004, the &quot;Research strategic plans  for labor safety and health for 1997-2001, 2001-2005, and 2005-2008&quot; and  &quot;Plans for 2009-2012&quot; were proposed. During January to June of 2008,  multiple internal and external conferences were held to collect valuable  insights of fellow researchers, professionals, and scholars. The Institute has  contributed to the investigation of domestic labor safety and health statu,  integration of international trend, assistance of disaster litigation project  of Council of Labor Affairs, introduction of overseas advanced technology, and  establishment of web-based database for local safety and health information.  Meanwhile, through seminars, conferences, technical transfers, and  publications, the Institute has accomplished positive outcome for the promotion  and application of research findings. Please visit the website of the Institute  for more information on research of occupational safety and health in Taiwan.<br />
    <h4>Safety and Health Technology Center (SAHTECH)</h4>

SAHTECH’s main RD field specializes in high-tech safety,  chemical safety, risk management, software design and establishment of various  management systems, such as Hazard Communication and Taiwan Occupational Safety  and Health Management System (TOSHMS), etc. SAHTECH is also a long-term partner  with competent authorities in developing and implementing national programs  such as the GHS and National Chemical Substances Inventory.<br />
    <h4>The Center for Control and Administration of Specific Medical  Antidotes in Emergencies (for chemical toxication)</h4>
  <p>The Center for Control and Administration of Specific Medical  Antidotes in Emergencies was established in 2000 at the Taipei Veterans General  Hospital by the Department of Health (DOH) of the Executive Yuan. Its purpose  was to build a nation-wide network of antidote stocking in order to: (1)  relieve difficulties faced by hospitals without specific antidotes in  toxicological emergencies, and (2) to establish a comprehensive poisoning  prevention system to respond to large-scale poisoning accidents, including  chemical accidents.</p>
  <h4>Taiwan Occupational Health Association</h4>
  <p>The Taiwan Occupational Health Association (TOHA) was founded in  1995. The aims of TOHA are 1) to receive requests to execute occupational  health researches 2) to organize occupational health-related discussion panels  3) to train and develop professionals engaged in occupational health technology  4) to encourage occupational health technology exchanges and strengthen  partnerships 5) to publish occupational health-related periodicals 6) to  promote policies enhancing health in job environments and to assist in implementing  policies to protect the health of workers. The committees in TOHA are  responsible for the promotion of occupational health in Taiwan. The average  number of members has increased by about 10%. TOHA members come from a wide  range of organizations including companies, schools, government organizations,  non-profit organizations and others. Every year TOHA publishes about 2,000  copies of seasonal periodicals with the latest information on occupational  health and safety information for all members and other organizations concerned  with job safety and health. In each year, TOHA also holds an annual national  industrial and occupational health and safety conference and discussion panel,  and publishes around 200 papers.<br />
    <h4>5.1.3 OSH information centres</h4>
    <h4>Emergency Response Information Center and Emergency Response Teams  for Chemical Accidents</h4>
  <p>The Emergency Response Information Center provides technical and  information support in chemical accident emergency response.  There is a 24-hour monitoring and reporting system  in place and seven emergency response teams can be dispatched to the accident  sites.<br />
    <h4>ITRI Emergency Response Information Center (ERIC)</h4>
  <p>Commencing 1996, Taiwan EPA established the Emergency Response  Information Center (ERIC) within Industrial Technology Research Institute  (ITRI) to provide technical support of toxic chemical accident emergency  response. Seven emergency response teams are operated in 7 cities in the north,  central and south regions to offer 24 hours/365 days service of chemical accident/spill  emergency response.</p>
  <h4>5.1.4 Occupational health services</h4>
  <p>Small and medium enterprises in traditional industries have always  been an important link in the economic development of Taiwan. However, with the  relatively shortage of manpower and materials, as well as the long term  shortage of inspection personnel, it is difficult to conduct all-round  inspection guidance so that the safety and health measures are not  comprehensive enough which attrite to the insufficient disaster prevention  resources of the less privileged traditional industries. The Council of Labour  Affairs hopes that the local governments will be able to guide and assist these  enterprises to improve their work environment based on the principle of  &quot;respect safety and life&quot;.</p>
  <p>To assist small and medium enterprises to established safe working  environment, the Council has provided workplace safety guidance to small and  medium enterprises and partnered with local labor administrative agencies to  promote &quot;Labor Safety and Health Local Program&quot; (or the so called  Dandelion Program). Counties and cities recruited volunteers to establish  on-site workplace safety visit team to implement disaster mitigation measures  such as &quot;on-site work safety guidance&quot;, &quot;safety facility subsidy&quot;,  &quot;educational training and on-site promotion&quot;, etc. to provide on-site  guidance, facility subsidy and disaster prevention promotion to small and  medium enterprises as well as micro projects in each city and county. Through  the local &quot;labor safety on-site visit volunteers&quot;, the accurate  disaster prevention information can be communicated to small and medium  enterprise under 50 staff, and spread &quot;Labor safety disaster prevention  message&quot; (safety and health seeds) just like the seeds of the dandelion to  every citizen and labor. Eventually, such message will be distributed to every  factory in Taiwan to effectively secure the life, safety, and health of each  and every worker.<br />
    <h4>5.1.5 Workmen's compensation and insurance schemes</h4>
  <p>Labor insurance is a mandatory social insurance based on  principles of self-help and mutual-aid to gather efforts of people and  government to secure labor life and enhance social safety in a way of sharing  risks. In addition, the Council of Labour Affairs (CLA) has proactively  realized labor insurance annuity system to establish a comprehensive social  safety net for retired labor. Taiwan has entered the era of aging society and  women are having fewer children, annuity benefits are the trend of our time.  Furthermore, the existing one-time payment of labor insurance is prone to  depreciate due to inflation or exhausted due to improper investment and not be  able to secure the long term economic security of labor and their survivors. To  cope with changes in Taiwan's demographic composition and secure long term life  security of labor and their survivors, amendment to labor insurance annuity  system was announced on August 13, 2008 and will be implemented on January 1,  2009. To cope with the adoption of labor insurance annuity system, the Council  continues to hold meetings to explain the system and promote the system in  media such as TV, newspapers, and radios to strengthen labor's understanding to  annuity system.</p>
  <p>Occupational injury insurance provides medical benefits and cash  subsidies for injury, disease, disability, or death of the insured when they  are job on-duty. The insurance reduces losses of the insured caused by  occupational hazards and provides life security to the insured and their  survivors.</p>
  <p>Employment insurance provides subsidies to enhance employment skills  of labor, enhance employment, secure basic life standards during unemployment,  and provide unemployment payments, allowances during training, early employment  allowances, allowances for universal health insurance premium, etc.  Occupational trainings and employment enhancement shall also be conducted with  funds from the employment insurance.</p>
  <h3>5.2 Professional education, training, retraining and raising of  qualification</h3>
  <p>There are various educational institutions which provide trainings  in occupational safety and health at various levels, as well as special  trainings for occupational health professionals, such as occupational  physicians and nurses.</p>
  <h4>5.2.1 Programmes of higher professional and postgraduate education</h4>
  <h4>Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene,  National Taiwan University</h4>
  <p>The Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene  (OMIH) of National Taiwan University was established in the year 1993, and it  is the first graduate institute majoring in occupational medicine and  industrial hygiene in Taiwan. The mission of the Institute is to advance the  health of all people in occupational and community settings in Taiwan, Asia,  and around the world through teaching, research, and services in occupational  and environmental health. Faculty members in the institute investigate causes,  risks, mechanisms, biomarkers, and prevention measures of environmentally and  occupationally related health issues, provide advanced education programs of  occupational health with master and doctoral degrees, and provide  scientifically based public health services to the public, governments,  industries, and the labors. Research approaches range from molecular to  epidemiologic, in physical scales of nano- to macro-, and by multiple  disciplines of physical, chemical, biological, sociobehavioral sciences, and  ergonomics. In most occasions, the Institute has tried to tackle important  public health problems that require integrated contributions of many advanced  specialties.</p>
  <h4>Other educational institutions in Taiwan</h4>
  <p>Besides the Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial  Hygiene at National Taiwan University, there are also other universities  offering the educational training in the fields of occupational safety and  health:<br />

  <h3>5.3 Specialized scientific, technical and medical institutions related to various aspects of OSH</h3>
  <h4>5.3.1 Standards setting bodies</h4>
  <p>The regulations, policies, and standards of OSH are established  and edited by the Department of Labor Safety and Health, Council of Labor  Affairs. The department is also responsible for instructing and supervising OSH  trainings. It encourages enterprises to implement the OSH management system  (OSHMS) to protect the safety and health of labors (see chapter 4.1).</p>
  <h4>5.3.2 Bodies  specializing in hazard and risk assessment</h4>
  <p>The Taiwan Chapter of Society for Risk Analysis (TCSRA) has been  officially chaptered and announced during the Society Risk Analysis (SRA) 2005  Annual Meeting. It is believed that with its establishment, it can not only  promote the advancement of research and education on risk analysis in Taiwan,  but also provide all professionals from diverse field opportunities to exchange  information, ideas, and methodologies for risk analysis and risk-problem  solution. In addition, it can be beneficial on human health and ecological risk  analysis and governmental decision-making process.</p>
  <p>Many of the TCSRA members are associated with research institutes  or universities and have backgrounds in environmental health and nature  sciences and social sciences. Their research activities are primarily related  to risk perception, social concerns, exposure assessment, toxicology,  environmental risk and food safety, exposure factor database in Taiwan,  risk-based recommended exposure limits in workplaces, health and ecological  risk assessment for pesticides, and application of statistics in risk  assessment. The study of risk altitudes and perception of nano-materials is  also under investigation by our memebrs. With members from various fields,  TCSRA has great potential to expand its interdisciplinary activities for risk  analysis.</p>
  <p>TCSRA is an officially registered organization as a nationwide  academic society in Taiwan by following the Taiwan Social Organization Law. The  Preparation Committee is working on invitation of international scholars and  guests to attend future annual events. Also, TCSRA intends to organize  workshops and seminars and encourage our members to work with other  international groups on various issues in risk analysis.</p>
  <h4>5.3.3 Bodies prepared  for safety operations in emergency situations</h4>
  <h4>Emergency Response Information Center (ERIC)</h4>
  <p>The Emergency Response Information Center (ERIC), established by Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), was the first emergency rescue center targeting industrial accidents involving hazardous chemicals. ERIC assisted industry in setting up emergency response and consulting services for handling hazardous accidents and providing Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, National Fire Agency, Ministry of the Interior, and relative industries with important emergency response information through Internet.</p>
  <h4>Taiwan Society of Emergency Medicine</h4>
	<p>Founded in 1994  by Professor Sheng-Chuan Hu and about 200 physicians sharing a commitment to  improving the quality of Taiwan’s emergency care, the Taiwan Society of  Emergency Medicine (TSEM) is the largest national medical speciality  organization representing physicians who practice emergency medicine. TSEM is  dedicated to the improvement of emergency care of acutely ill and injured  patients in hospital and prehospital environments by improving research and  education in the specialty.</p>
	<p>The missions of  TSEM are as follow:</p>
	<p>1.     To promote research in emergency medicine.<br />
	  2.     To improve the quality of emergency care in  hospital and prehospital environments.<br />
	  3.     To popularize resuscitation skills.<br />
	  4.     To facilitate the interchange of clinical  experiences in emergency medicine.<br />
	  5.     To develop and monitor an emergency  medicine residency program.<br />
	  6.     To promote international and interspecialty  academic interchange and collaboration.<br />
	  7.     To advance continuing medical education in  the specialty.<br />
	  8.     To promote the general welfare of emergency  medicine.</p>
	<p>In cooperation  with the Department of Health, TSEM plays an important role in the development  and improvement of emergency medical care systems in Taiwan. TSEM has also  actively participated in the coordination of medical care in many major  domestic disasters such as the 921 earthquake in 1999 and the SARS outbreak in  2003. Whenever the public needs emergency care, TSEM is there providing rescue  and medical services on the front line.</p>
	<p>In 1997,  emergency medicine was recognized as the 23rd medical specialty by the  Department of Health, a major milestone for TSEM and its members. Since then,  TSEM has been responsible for the development and monitoring of emergency  medicine residency programs. The society also provides in-depth continuing  professional education for physicians, nurses and ancillary emergency health  care practitioners and supports academic research in the specialty. Through  these efforts, TSEM expects to improve the quality of emergency care in Taiwan.</p>  
  <h4>5.3.4 Insurance bodies</h4>
  <p>The Government of the Republic of China established its labor  insurance program in March 1950, which is the first compulsory social insurance  program. Successively later on, the Craft Workers' Insurance Program was  carried out in 1951, and the Fishermen's Insurance in 1953. However, the  Government promulgated the Labor Insurance Act until 1958 and put it into  effect in 1960. In the meantime, all the three separate programs were nullified.  The Act was amended in 1968, 1973, 1979, 1988, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2008  for the purposes of expanding its coverage for more labor, offering better  protection, and providing more generous benefits. Thus, the function of the  Program has been successfully promoted. After March 1995, the medical care for  ordinary accident is provided by the National Health Program. Due to the  cooperation and support of the majority of employers and employees of various  industries during the past forty years, the outcome of the Program is quite  encouraging. The success of the Program has effectively helped the Government  carry out its economic development plan, resulting in a rapid economic growth,  which is well-known worldwide. As a consequence, more labor are covered by the  program with more benefits.</p>
  <p>In order to build up a complete labor insurance pension protection  system and offer the insured person or insured person’s dependents long term  living care, the government deliberates upon the opinions from all walks of  life,&nbsp;takes Taiwan's unique economic and social situation into  consideration and learns from the experience of advanced countries in the  implementation of pension system to plan disability, old-age and survivor’s  pension system, and the system has come into force on January 1, 2009. Before  that, the labor insurance offers cash benefits include: maternity, injury or  sickness, disability, old-age and death benefits. After the implementation of  labor insurance pension program, monthly pension approach for claiming  disability, old-age and death benefits has been added ,which are “old-age  pension benefits”, “disability pension benefits” and “survivor pension  benefits”. Through the implementation of the labor insurance pension scheme,  labors will obtain more complete labor insurance protection.</p>
  <h4>Bureau of Labor Insurance</h4>
  <p>The first social insurance program in Taiwan – labor insurance –  began in 1950. Since its implementation, the statutes governing the labor  insurance system have undergone revisions several times in response to social  changes and economic development. These amendments have expanded the range of  insurance beneficiaries, gradually increased different types of benefits,  progressively lowered requirements of benefits payment and brought about greater  protection for the laborers' work and lives. Labor insurance lifted the curtain  on our country’s social insurance system. As various social security systems  were promoted, the delegated businesses operated by the Bureau of Labor  Insurance have increased and diversified. The Bureau of Labor Insurance’s  organization has thus been increasingly growing in size, providing protection  and services for laborers. The following sections will introduce the  organizational structure, business profile, and future perspectives of the  Bureau of Labor Insurance (hereafter referred to as BLI).</p>
  <p>The BLI's primary mission is the handling of labor insurance  services; it has also continually been commissioned other social security  services. The scope of the BLI's services has been expanded to include social  insurance, labor protection, social welfare allowances and so on. The BLI has  been commissioned to handle the collection and disbursement of overdue wages  payment since November 1986, as well as farmers' health insurance, which the  Ministry of Interior entrusted to the BLI since July 1989. In June 1995, the  Council of Agriculture commissioned the BLI to handle the oldage farmers'  welfare allowance program. On April 28, 2002, the BLI was commissioned to  handle the subsidies of occupational accident labor protection. In June 2002,  the BLI was commissioned by the Ministry of Interior and the Council of  Indigenous Peoples, Executive Yuan to handle the old-age citizens' and  indigenes' welfare allowance programs. On January 1, 2003, the BLI began to  implement the employment insurance program; on July 1, 2005, it started  implementing the new labor pension program. On October 1, 2008, the BLI was  commissioned by the Ministry of Interior to implement the national pension  program.</p>
  <h3>5.4 Overall national level of human resources active in the area  of OSH</h3>
  <p>There are 80 lifetime members, 128 regular members and 98 student members in TOHA. TOHA members come from a wide range of organizations including companies, schools, government organizations, non-profit organizations and others. Every year this association publishes about 2,000 copies of seasonal periodicals with the latest information on occupational health and safety information for all TOHA members and other organizations concerned with job safety and health. Each year, we arrange a nationwide industrial and occupational health and safety discussion panel and publish around 200 papers.</p>
  <h4>5.4.1 Occupational health services personnel and safety  personnel</h4>
  <p>There are three major types of occupational safety and health  personnel. That is, Occupational safety and health professionals and experts,  workplace safety and health personnel, and OSH inspectors. There are three  major types of occupational safety and health personnel. That is, Occupational  safety and health professionals and experts, workplace safety and health personnel,  and OSH inspectors. Currently there are about 40,000 occupational safety and  health professionals including 250 occupational health physicians in Taiwan.</p>
  <h4>5.4.2 Number of environmental protection specialists</h4>
  <p>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) of Taiwan is  responsible of the environmental protection activities. The EPA governs seven  departments: comprehensive planning, air quality protection and noise control,  water quality protection, waste management, environmental sanitation and toxic  substance management, supervision evaluation and dispute resolution,  environmental monitoring and information management.&nbsp;Each city and county  government gradually set up an Environmental Protection Bureau to enhance  environmental protection work and function between 1988 and 1991. In total,  there are 25 regional bureau of environmental protection.</p>

<h2><a href="#6" name="6">6 Statistics on occupational accidents and diseases</a></h2>
<h3>6.1 Fundamentals of qualifying cases of occupational injuries and diseases</h3>
<h4>Taiwan’s occupational injury and disease reporting system</h4>
The discovery rate of occupational disease in Taiwan is far lower than industrialized countries (occupational disease incidence in Taiwan was 23 per million labors in 2003, while it was 118 in Korea, 125 in Japan, 239 in Singapore, and 259 in the U.K.), this is the result of the absence of occupational disease reporting system. The Council has planned to establish a reporting system within two years (in the first year, plan and complete system connections among eight treatment centers and all occupational injury and disease outpatient systems; in the second year, complete system connections among all hospitals nationwide）. The reporting system allows administrative agencies to get hold of number of occupational injury and disease cases in a timely manner to solve the issue of under-estimate of occupational injury and disease incidence in Taiwan.
<br /><br />
  Since 2002, the Council of Labour Affairs has planned Occupational  Injury and Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers in major medicine centers  in north, central, south, and east parts of Taiwan. This arrangement connects  the community network and offers the labours easier access to services in  diagnostic, treatment, investigation, examination, and report.<br />
  <br />
  In order to enhance the occupational injury and disease service  quality and establish a platform for communication, since 2007, the  administrative services related to occupational injury and disease are  transferred from the Department of Health to Council of Labour Affairs, and the  Council of Labour Affairs thus authorizes National Taiwan University to  implement the “Occupational Injury and Disease Service Management Center Plan”,  where a “occupational injury and disease reporting system” (not related to the  past reporting system in the Department of Health) is established. In the mean  time, all the Occupational Injury and Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers  are all included in the reporting system.<br />
  <br />
  In addition, the Bureau of Labour Insurance also developed a  “Preventive Occupational Disease Health Examination System” with the Institute  of Occupational Safety and Health, with the view to provide funds for special  labour health insurance.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Present situation in occupational disaster and occupational  disease reporting system</strong><br />
  <br />
  The  current reporting system in Taiwan is divided into two categories: occupational  disaster and occupational disease. The statistic sources of occupational  disaster from the government come from: 1) occupational injuries under labour  insurance 2) reported serious occupational disaster information by labour  inspection 3) monthly occupational disaster reports to the Council of Labour  Affairs by each enterprise. The former two sources are more often quoted;  however, besides the serious occupational disaster are reported, other  occupational accidents, regardless of its seriousness, are not required to be  reported. The employers are reluctant to do so as well. Therefore, the  occupational disaster data are often underestimated. Because of the difference  in legal basis, purpose of the data, data collecting incentives, legal  requirements, data sources, reporting interface, and the instantaneity of the  data. In conclusion, Taiwan is in need of an integrated reporting system.</p>
<p>As for  the reporting statistics of occupational disease, Taiwan has always had  underestimated diagnosed cases. The Council of Labour Affairs and the  Department of Health have their own system, but the occupational disease cases  from the labour insurance is still the main database. In addition, the  “occupational injury and disease reporting system” set up by the Department of  Health has also transferred this service to the Council of Labour Affairs in  2007. If occupational disease doctors identify cases that are occupational  disease, they can then automatically report it to the Department of Health, and  then it will be investigated by peers. Yet since the reporting possibilities  mentioned above don’t have legal compulsory basis, therefore the reporting are  not completely carried out and thus result in the difference in data.</p>

<h3>6.2 Key indicators of occupational injuries and diseases</h3>
<p>The Council consigned medical associations to establish determination standards for occupational disease. 108 standards were established and posted on website of the Council to serve as reference for doctors. However, with the advancement in the medical field, there have been suggestions from all circles of life on amendments for determination standards. The Council will consign professionals, scholars and related medical associations to review and amend the standards on an annual basis. In recent years, determination standards for exhaustion (acute cardiovascular disease triggered by vocation), chemical poisoning (such as manganese, benzene, n-Hexane, and beryllium), and bone and muscle injury in waist and neck have been amended. Furthermore, with the rapid industrial transformation and significant increase of workers in financial sector, these workers experience unhealthy work conditions such as overtime, abnormal shifts, and stress in order to confront with global competition. In addition, emerging occupational disease such as mental disorders (e.g. depression) invoked by vocation happens quite frequently. In the future, the Council will work with Labor Safety and Health Research Institute to proactively collect and compare the determination standards of newly emerging occupational disease in countries such as Japan. The research results plus the local research findings can serve as reference for the development of determination standards or benchmarks to strengthen labor protection.</p>

<h2><a href="#7" name="7">7 Policies and programmes of employers' and workers' organizations</a></h2>
<h3>7.1 Labor Unions</h3>
<h4>Taiwan Confederation of Trade Unions (TCTU)</h4>
<p>After years of labor movement struggle, the Taiwan Confederation  of Trade Unions (TCTU), Taiwan's first legal and autonomous national trade  union, was recognized by the government on May 1, 2000. Although TCTU is young,  it is the most active labor organization in Taiwan. TCTU is rooted in the long  history of working class struggle on our island. We believe this history is  vital to the continuing development of the labor movement and its role in  building a democratic society in Taiwan.</p>
<p>TCTU currently includes 21 member  unions, including telecommunication, petroleum, tobacco, alcohol, railway, bus,  and banking industries and 9 local trade union federations. Local unions in  un-represented counties are also actively working towards the formation of  county federations, and plan to affiliate with TCTU.</p>
<p>To deal with the changing  environment in Taiwan, TCTU has established several committees. First, the <strong><em>Organizing  Drive Committee</em></strong>&nbsp;promotes  the formation of union federations among industries or regions, and raises the  union participation rate in Taiwan. Second, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Labor Law Policy Committee</em></strong>&nbsp;fights for reforms of the present  system of labor regulations, and prepares for future attacks on workers'  interests by the government national pension plan. TCTU has set up a&nbsp;<strong><em>Committee on Privatization&nbsp;</em></strong>to critique and monitor the  government's privatization schemes. To deal with the crisis of unemployment and  plant closures, we have established an&nbsp;<strong><em>Unemployment  and Employment Committee</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Under the globalized capitalst  economy, we know that the situations, conditions and struggles of Taiwan's workers  are shared by yhe working class around the world. Therefore, TCTU also tries to  communicate and cooperate with international labor organizations, participating  in conferences, and international campaigns through our&nbsp;<strong><em>International Department</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese labor movement has  fought towards the creation of TCTU for more than a decade, but our mission has  just begun. There are more and more challenges ahead of us now and we look  forward to continuing our struggle and contributions towards a just and equitablesociety  for workers in Taiwan and around the world. </p>
<h4>The National Federation of Bank Employees Unions (NFBEU)</h4>
<p>After  the abolishment of&nbsp;<em>the Martial Law</em>&nbsp;in 1987, for the gradual deregulation of  the banking sector and liberalization and internationalization of financial  policies strongly enforced by the government, the banking industry here in  Taiwan has been confronting keen competitions and pressures in the  market.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of bank employees has also  rapidly increased.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the authoritarian  regime and the revision of&nbsp;<em>the Settling Labor Dispute Law</em>, the &quot;Three Labor Rights&quot; of  bank employees could be legally claimed.&nbsp;Based on these transformations,  employees of the banking sector realized that only workers united to organize  unions could they fight against unfairness and demand for their rights.</p>
<p>In  1988, bank employees realized the importance of being united and began to  organize unions.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, by Article 49 of&nbsp;<em>the Labor Union Law</em>, &quot;The National Federation of Bank  Employees Unions&quot; (NFBEU), initiated by 9 unions including the Bank Trade  Union Federations of Taipei City, Kaohsiung City, Taipei County, Taoyuan  County, Miaoli County, Taichung City, Tainan City, Hualian County, and Yilan  County, applied for legal recognition by sending required documents to the  Council of Labor Affairs, Executive Yuan (CLA), the central competent authority  of labor affairs in Taiwan. Unfortunately, the CLA then rejected the  application due to the not-timely statutes in labor laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider practically and realistically  for union movement, &quot;The National Federation of Bank Employees  Unions&quot; formally announced its establishment on September 6th,  1993.</p>




<h2><a href="#8" name="8">8 Regular and on-going activities related to OSH: Examples</a></h2>
<h3>8.1 Regular activities at the national level</h3>
<h4>8.1.1 National initiatives</h4>
<h4>National Occupational Safety and Health Week</h4>
<p>In order to strengthen the awareness of workplace safety among  citizens, Council of Labor Affairs has planned a series of activities in the  National Occupational Safety and Health Week since 2006, which has triggered  great attention from around the country. Related agencies have proactively held  various disaster mitigation promotion and guidance activities to effectively  enhance the overall safety and health standards of Taiwan as a whole. To  continuously establish the mechanism for participation of work place safety by  citizens and increase the knowledge and capacity of disaster mitigation in the  workplace, the Council expanded the scope of Occupational Safety Week (July 1  to July 7) and Occupational Health Week (May 1 to May 7) incorporating the  subject of facilitation of occupational health in 2008 to effectively integrate  efforts from government agencies, city and county governments, large  public-owned and private enterprises, industrial parks, and science parks to  conduct activities such as promotion of workplace safety and health, trainings,  seminars, guidance, and community outreach.</p>
<h4>National Industrial Safety Award</h4>
<p>In order to encourage enterprises and individuals to promote  safety and health in the workplace, and to promote mechanism for full citizen  participation of work safety, In 2007 the Council established the first  national occupational safety and health honor: &quot;National Industrial Safety  Award&quot; to establish role models for high-quality occupational safety and  health culture.</p>
<p>The award was given based on the enterprise's closed loop  management of safety and health strategies, organizations, systems, planning,  performance, implementation, inspection, and correction. The objectives of the  award are to realize the full participation of work safety within enterprise,  integrate the concept of respect life into the core value of the enterprise,  establish high quality occupational safety and health, and create the sustainable  vision of the enterprise.</p>
<h3>8.2 International collaboration</h3>

<p>ISEE is an international  organization with members from more than 50 countries and regional chapters and  local groups in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, Central and  Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, South Asia, and East Asia. </p>
<p>The 9th annual conference of the  International Society for Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) was held at the  Academia Sinica International Center in Taipei, Taiwan, August 17 to 20, 1997.  The theme of the conference, organized by Dr. Chien-Jen Chen, was &quot;Meeting  of the West and the East: Prevention of Environmental Diseases through  Integrated International Efforts.&quot; More than 200 scientists from 37  countries attended the meeting.</p>
<h4>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) Chemical Dialogue</h4>
<p>The Chemical Dialogue (CD) serves as  a forum for regulatory officials and industry representatives to find solutions  to challenges facing the chemical industry and users of chemicals in the  Asia-Pacific region. It reflects APEC members' recognition of the importance of  engaging with the private sector and building public-private sector dialogue  and cooperation for mutual benefit.</p>
The 9th APEC Chemical Dialogue was held in  Hiroshima, Japan on March 1 to March 4, 2010.
<h4>Science Committee on Epidemiology in Occupational Health (EPICOH)</h4>
<p>The Scientific Committee on Epidemiology in Occupational Health (EPICOH) of the ICOH has as its main function promotion of communication among epidemiologists, industrial hygienists, and other occupational health scientists worldwide. EPICOH provides a forum for the discussion of problems unique to the study of health and work. With membership open to occupational epidemiologists and other scientists worldwide, EPICOH provides a variety of forums for discussions, critical reviews, collaborations and education on issues of occupational exposures and their human health effects.</p>
<p>The 2010 EPICOH-Medichem Conference was held in Taipei, Taiwan. The mission of this conference is to make whole world's workplaces safer, healthier and more productive. We do this by bringing together and sharing knowledge and information, to promote a culture of risk prevention. Through the conference, we share good practice, and communicate information in a variety of ways to reach workers and workplaces, especially in this new technology century. This conference aims to identify new and emerging risks. In order to achieve this, it will give an overview of safety and health at work in the world, describe the trends and underlying factors, and anticipate changes in work and their likely consequences for safety and health. Additionally, it aims to stimulate debate and reflection among company's stakeholders and to provide a platform for debate between policy-makers at various levels.</p>

  <h3>9.2 Levels of literacy</h3>
  <p>By 1994, Taiwan's literacy rate had jumped to 94%, a 34% increase  from 1952 when less than 60% of people older than 15 could read and write.  Compulsory education is for children between  the ages of 6-15 and was increased to nine years, thus extending to education  to when students finish junior high school.  </p>
  <p>The pass rate for junior high graduates on their high school  entrance exam is a low 20%, about 2/3 attending a vocational school. About  700,000 students attend over a hundred available universities and colleges in  Taiwan.</p>
  <h3>9.3 Economic data</h3>
  <p>The gross domestic product (GDP) of  Taiwan in 2009 was 693.3 billion US dollars. The annual<br />
    per capita income was 30,200 US  dollars. Finland was No. 40 in the ranking of GDP/capita.</p>
