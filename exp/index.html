			<strong>Mandarin-English Bilinguals’ Conception of time</strong><br/>
		    My name is Meng Tsen Shih, and I am a graduate student at the University of Hawaii (UH). A requirement of my Master’s degree program is to conduct a research project. The purpose of my project is to find out how bilinguals think about time.  Participation in this study will involve the completion of an on-line (Internet) experiment.  I am asking you to participate in this project because you are over 18 years old.
		</p>
		<p>
		    <strong>Project Description - Activities and Time Commitment: </strong>
		    If you participate, you will do an experiment that is posted on the Internet.  The task in this experiment is to judge if a given sentence is true or not as quickly as possible.  Completion of the survey will take approximately 30 minutes. The experiment will be completed online, and your IP address will not be recorded. If you take part, you will be one of eighty people who participate.
		</p>
		<p>
		    <strong>Benefits and Risks: </strong>
		   There will be no direct benefit to you for participating in this survey. The results of this project may contribute to a better understanding of bilinguals’ language processing.   I believe there is little or no risk to you in participating in this project.  If you are uncomfortable or stressed by doing the experiment, you can skip the question, or take a break, or stop the trials or withdraw from the project altogether. There is little risk to you in participating in this project.
		</p>
		<p>
		    <strong>Confidentiality and Privacy: </strong>
		    My academic advisor and I will be the only ones that have access to the data, although legally authorized agencies, including the University of Hawai‘i Human Studies Program, have the right to review research records. Your responses will not be linked with your identity – in our records and in any publication of the results, you will be identified by number, not by name.  Although your name will not be collected, I will collect your email for the distribution of gift card upon completi1on of study.
		</p>
		<p>
		    <strong>Voluntary Participation:</strong>
		    Participation in this project is voluntary. You can freely choose to participate or to not participate in this experiment, and there will be no penalty or loss.   As compensation for time spent participating in the research project, you will receive $5 gift card.  The gift card will be sent by email once the experiment is completed.

				Thank you for participating in the experiment! 
				In this experiment, you will read sentences, and your task is to decide whether each sentence is TRUE or FALSE.   Some sentences are descriptions of a picture that you see, others are general statements.   In each case, your job is to decide whether the sentence is TRUE or FALSE.   For TRUE, press the “a” key. For FALSE, press the “k” key.
